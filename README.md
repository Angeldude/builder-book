# Builder Book

Starting over and running through the builder book tutorial.

* Setup node.js
* vscode config
* next js
* Material UI integration
* server side rendering.

Not bad, the book is a bit rough at times with little to no explanation of what we're doing but I managed.

To run locally, install dependencies using `yarn install` and then `yarn dev`
